00:07:12.212 --> 00:07:13.346
(LAUGHS)

00:07:13.348 --> 00:07:15.347
You better stop it, man.

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:16.381
Don't you start that.

00:07:16.383 --> 00:07:18.050
That was a master class.

00:07:18.052 --> 00:07:20.019
I couldn't get Bobby Flay
to buy that beast.

00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:22.087
You know what?
Once I saw the man purse,

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:24.089
the guy was putty in my hands.
He really was.

00:07:24.091 --> 00:07:25.123
(BOTH LAUGHING)

00:07:25.125 --> 00:07:26.925
Teddy, I just want you to know

00:07:26.927 --> 00:07:29.361
you are like the son
I never had.

00:07:29.363 --> 00:07:31.399
Well, I mean, come on,
you got Joe Junior.

00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:35.368
Well, yeah,
but he's the son I do have,

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.570
and I'm just not
all that crazy about it.

00:07:37.572 --> 00:07:39.237
I mean, look at him.

00:07:39.239 --> 00:07:42.141
But my point is this...
all those years ago,

00:07:42.143 --> 00:07:44.610
I took a chance
on a pimply-faced teenager.

00:07:44.612 --> 00:07:47.212
My little Gary Coleman.

00:07:47.214 --> 00:07:48.614
My little Webster.

00:07:48.616 --> 00:07:52.050
And it turned out great
for both of us.

00:07:52.052 --> 00:07:55.123
So I've decided,
when I retire...

00:07:56.491 --> 00:07:58.591
I'm turning Barbecue City...

00:07:58.593 --> 00:08:01.926
over... to you.

00:08:01.928 --> 00:08:03.595
Excuse me?

00:08:03.597 --> 00:08:05.330
- What?
- (CHUCKLING)

00:08:05.332 --> 00:08:07.233
Uh, don't-don't shit me.

00:08:07.235 --> 00:08:08.334
I'm serious.

00:08:08.336 --> 00:08:10.001
Oh, my God, Joe.

00:08:10.003 --> 00:08:11.403
I just got-got goose bumps.

00:08:11.405 --> 00:08:13.872
- Yes!
- I got goose bumps all over.

00:08:13.874 --> 00:08:15.373
I don't know what to say, man.
Thank you.

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:17.108
No. Thank you...

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.477
son.

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:20.646
What you talkin' 'bout, Joe?

00:08:20.648 --> 00:08:22.881
- (LAUGHING)
- You gotta come here, Mr. Drummond.

00:08:22.883 --> 00:08:23.917
Come here.

00:08:25.118 --> 00:08:27.054
JOE:
All yours, Teddy.

00:08:28.455 --> 00:08:29.988
- What do you think?
- Oh...

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.590
(CHUCKLES) It's amazing.

00:08:31.592 --> 00:08:32.525
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:08:32.527 --> 00:08:34.993
But as your unofficial
financial advisor,

00:08:34.995 --> 00:08:36.294
I'm obligated to tell you

00:08:36.296 --> 00:08:38.296
that this ring is way out
of your budget.

00:08:38.298 --> 00:08:39.564
Relax.

00:08:39.566 --> 00:08:40.598
Lisa's cool as hell.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.000
She knows who you are.

00:08:42.002 --> 00:08:43.636
Lisa does not know who I am.

00:08:43.638 --> 00:08:46.338
Lisa knows that I'm
a successful barbecue salesman.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.173
Marvin knows that Teddy's
a high school dropout

00:08:48.175 --> 00:08:50.208
that's living
paycheck to paycheck

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.243
'cause I'm with a woman that's
way above my weight class.

00:08:52.245 --> 00:08:54.613
Your life is built
on a financial house of cards.

00:08:54.615 --> 00:08:56.649
- Stop it.
- The Porsche, the duplex.

00:08:56.651 --> 00:08:58.684
What are you trying to prove?

00:08:58.686 --> 00:09:00.185
Plus, every single time
we go out,

00:09:00.187 --> 00:09:01.553
she offers to pay
for the check.

00:09:01.555 --> 00:09:03.254
The day that I let her
put down her plastic

00:09:03.256 --> 00:09:04.422
is the day that I lose her.

00:09:04.424 --> 00:09:06.692
- And you know that.
- I don't know why I was so nervous.

00:09:06.694 --> 00:09:08.093
- LISA: It's coming together.
- Hey.

00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:09.627
- Hi.
- Lisa.

00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:11.463
- Hi!
- Bienvenue.

00:09:11.465 --> 00:09:14.366
Dude, Lisa's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:09:14.368 --> 00:09:17.134
I don't want to mess
this one up, man.

00:09:17.136 --> 00:09:19.003
- (LAUGHING): I told them.
- He did.

00:09:19.005 --> 00:09:20.271
- (LAUGHTER)
- He actually said that.

00:09:20.273 --> 00:09:21.706
- Ooh.
- Look at that.

00:09:21.708 --> 00:09:23.041
- That looks amazing.
- Some dessert.

00:09:23.043 --> 00:09:24.242
- Wow.
- Wow. Thank you.

00:09:24.244 --> 00:09:26.211
- Mmm. - Thank you so much.
- WAITER: Chef Clemont also said

00:09:26.213 --> 00:09:27.412
that there will be no check.

00:09:27.414 --> 00:09:29.647
This is all on him.

00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:31.516
- Wow.
- LISA: I knew he would try this.

00:09:31.518 --> 00:09:33.518
You know what?
Tell him I appreciate it,

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.120
- but I insist on paying.
- Okay.

00:09:35.122 --> 00:09:36.454
- Yeah.
- Okay, well, just wait.

00:09:36.456 --> 00:09:38.323
Well, hold on, now, honey.

00:09:38.325 --> 00:09:39.457
Honey, you don't want
to offend him.

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:41.058
You're his guest, right?

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.527
Trust me, you never take
a free meal from a client.

00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:43.661
That way,
you don't owe them anything.

00:09:43.663 --> 00:09:45.263
- That's true.
- Thank you, Lisa.

00:09:45.265 --> 00:09:46.364
- I appreciate it.
- You know.

00:09:46.366 --> 00:09:47.532
- Um...
- WAITER: Whenever you're ready.

00:09:47.534 --> 00:09:49.066
LISA:
Thank you.

00:09:49.068 --> 00:09:50.635
You know what?
You know what, then, baby?

00:09:50.637 --> 00:09:52.136
If that's the case,
sweetie, then let me...

00:09:52.138 --> 00:09:53.504
No. Baby, this is my thing.

00:09:53.506 --> 00:09:55.340
There's like eight of us.
I got it.

00:09:55.342 --> 00:09:57.142
- You can probably write it off, right?
- Yes.

00:09:57.144 --> 00:09:59.344
I didn't think about that.
It is a business expense.

00:09:59.346 --> 00:10:00.612
- Okay. - LISA: Yeah.
- Come on.

00:10:00.614 --> 00:10:02.045
MAYA: W-W-Wait, wait.
Hold-hold up, Lis.

00:10:02.047 --> 00:10:04.448
It is a business expense,
but, Lis...

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.418
it's clear that Teddy
really wants to treat.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.188
We're all here celebrating you,
so let him.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.489
(TEDDY SIGHS QUIETLY)

00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:13.223
Right, Teddy?

00:10:13.225 --> 00:10:14.692
(CHUCKLES) Yes.

00:10:14.694 --> 00:10:15.760
Wow.

00:10:15.762 --> 00:10:18.530
Yes. Wh-Why aren't we closer?

00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:19.764
- 'Cause you get me.
- (CHUCKLES) Mmm.

00:10:19.766 --> 00:10:21.433
I have it. I got it.

00:10:21.435 --> 00:10:22.634
- I love you.
- Love you back.

00:10:22.636 --> 00:10:24.001
Black love.

00:10:24.003 --> 00:10:25.369
TEDDY:
Okay.

00:10:25.371 --> 00:10:27.237
Oh, shit.

00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:28.405
All right, Marvin, hit me.

00:10:28.407 --> 00:10:29.641
Thank you.

00:10:29.643 --> 00:10:31.743
- This is so good.
- One of my favorite things that he does.

00:10:31.745 --> 00:10:33.478
- That caramel tart, he's known for it.
- TEDDY: All right.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.447
Oh, I gotta get in that.

00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:37.181
Definitely gonna try that.

00:10:37.183 --> 00:10:38.248
Uh-uh.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.751
- MAYA: So amazing.
- LISA: Aren't these beautiful?

00:10:39.753 --> 00:10:41.452
- He did these just for us.
- Really?

00:10:41.454 --> 00:10:43.121
Yeah.
You should try this caramel.

00:10:43.123 --> 00:10:44.255
I'm gonna... I'm gonna take
a little bit of it.

00:10:44.257 --> 00:10:46.591
- Get in there.
- Take me through... take me through...

00:10:46.593 --> 00:10:48.158
Lisa, take me through.
So this is a chair.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.293
Straight up, it's a chair.

00:10:49.295 --> 00:10:51.061
I know that much, but what...
tell me about... give me

00:10:51.063 --> 00:10:52.029
the Behind the Music
about the chair.

00:10:52.031 --> 00:10:53.263
Pretend I'm on VH1
or something like that.

00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:55.400
Well, actually, these chairs
have a very interesting story.

00:10:55.402 --> 00:10:56.768
They're from Denmark.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.770
- Found them in a warehouse.
- MARVIN: Whoa.

00:10:58.772 --> 00:11:01.438
Mid-century, modern,
kind of rounded.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.372
- MARVIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- (GROANS QUIETLY)

00:11:02.374 --> 00:11:03.574
- I know it's blue and...
- (PLUCKING SOUND)

00:11:03.576 --> 00:11:05.476
- LISA: I didn't know you were so into chairs.
- (GRUNTS)

00:11:05.478 --> 00:11:06.578
Oh, you would not believe...
I'll go home,

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.779
I'll look at my chair,
I get turned on in a second.

00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:09.814
- It's just a weird fetish.
- You would love these because...

00:11:09.816 --> 00:11:12.282
I don't know if you noticed
the cerulean kind of

00:11:12.284 --> 00:11:13.617
- undertone of the wallpaper...
- Woof.

00:11:13.619 --> 00:11:16.220
...but we kind of wanted
to tie it all together,

00:11:16.222 --> 00:11:18.089
to kind of offset the harder,
more straighter lines,

00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:19.624
- and...
- What is that? I...

00:11:19.626 --> 00:11:21.559
I found this fabric in Italy.
It's 100%...

00:11:21.561 --> 00:11:23.160
Oh, my God.

00:11:23.162 --> 00:11:23.962
(CHUCKLES)

00:11:23.964 --> 00:11:25.797
- Oh, my God!
- (UTENSILS DROPPING)

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:28.065
- No, no, no!
- What?

00:11:28.067 --> 00:11:29.801
Is there a problem
with the dessert, sir?

00:11:29.803 --> 00:11:31.503
I think that's pubic hair
in the cake.

00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:33.070
- MARVIN: Oh, my God.
- LISA: Oh, my gosh.

00:11:33.072 --> 00:11:34.505
Is this pubic hair
in my damn dessert?

00:11:34.507 --> 00:11:35.341
May I?

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:39.376
- I'm sorry, what?
- May I please take it?

00:11:39.378 --> 00:11:41.178
Literally,
I'm telling you what it is.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.114
Uh...

00:11:48.087 --> 00:11:50.122
This is way too many pubes.

00:11:51.156 --> 00:11:52.256
What does that mean?

00:11:52.258 --> 00:11:53.625
I mean, one is too many pubes.

00:11:53.627 --> 00:11:55.158
If you could tell the chef.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.628
Thank you. Thank you for
taking care of this for us.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.529
I believe you planted these.

00:11:58.531 --> 00:12:00.764
- (LISA GASPS) - No, no, no.
- What'd you just say?

00:12:00.766 --> 00:12:02.599
MARVIN: Stop. I got this.
That's insane of you.

00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:04.368
I've known this man
my entire life.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.504
- He's not a pube planter, sir.
- TEDDY: No, no, no.

00:12:06.506 --> 00:12:08.539
Stop, Marv. Stop.
Maybe you planted them.

00:12:08.541 --> 00:12:10.107
- What?
- Boom.

00:12:10.109 --> 00:12:11.675
I risked my life
coming to this country

00:12:11.677 --> 00:12:13.644
so I can plant pubes on
some random guy's cheesecake?

00:12:13.646 --> 00:12:15.212
I don't know
what you're into, man.

00:12:15.214 --> 00:12:16.880
And I have a flash of news
for you, guy.

00:12:16.882 --> 00:12:19.416
- I man-scape down here.
- TEDDY: Okay.

00:12:19.418 --> 00:12:21.418
That's my woman, and that's
too much information.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.654
And these are the pubes

00:12:23.656 --> 00:12:25.656
of an African-American guy.

00:12:25.658 --> 00:12:28.224
- MARVIN: Oh, shit.
- What? That's racist, man.

00:12:28.226 --> 00:12:29.459
It's descriptive.

00:12:29.461 --> 00:12:31.395
- "Descriptive," my ass. That's racist.
- Luis?

00:12:31.397 --> 00:12:33.730
That's what they are...
Afro pubes.

00:12:33.732 --> 00:12:34.731
Friends, friends,
what is happening?

00:12:34.733 --> 00:12:35.732
What is happening?

00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:37.167

00:31:27.794 --> 00:31:29.627
Let's just put it like this.

00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:31.829
The revolution
will not be roboticized.

00:31:31.831 --> 00:31:33.431
Mm-hmm.

00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:34.865
Not on Jay's watch.

00:31:34.867 --> 00:31:36.567
Huh?

00:31:36.569 --> 00:31:38.568
Real nigga shit.

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:39.770
- Huh?
- CARRIE: Thank you, Jaylen.

00:31:39.772 --> 00:31:41.372
I'll make sure
I don't bring my Roomba

00:31:41.374 --> 00:31:42.473
to the next class.

00:31:42.475 --> 00:31:44.909
My wife takes rumba classes.

00:31:44.911 --> 00:31:46.811
- I don't get it.
- CARRIE: Let's keep it moving.

00:31:46.813 --> 00:31:48.411
Uh, how about you, ma'am?

00:31:48.413 --> 00:31:49.914
- Yeah.
- Oh.

00:31:49.916 --> 00:31:51.514
Okay. Hi, gang.

00:31:51.516 --> 00:31:52.783
My name is Theresa,

00:31:52.785 --> 00:31:54.618
and I dropped out
of high school

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.654
when I was pregnant
with my first child.

00:31:56.656 --> 00:31:58.489
My now-husband, Randy,

00:31:58.491 --> 00:32:00.423
well, we got married
after he knocked me up.

00:32:00.425 --> 00:32:01.859
Then we had two more kids,
so we have

00:32:01.861 --> 00:32:03.626
three little rascals now,
and it's fun.

00:32:03.628 --> 00:32:05.362
- (IMITATES GUNSHOT)
- We're just a little underwater

00:32:05.364 --> 00:32:07.765
right now, so I wanted
to get my GED and hopefully

00:32:07.767 --> 00:32:10.300
enter the workforce
before it's too late

00:32:10.302 --> 00:32:12.672
and we have to live in
Randy's parents' laundry room.

00:32:18.544 --> 00:32:20.377
I'm blessed.

00:32:20.379 --> 00:32:21.812
So blessed.

00:32:21.814 --> 00:32:23.513
God is good.

00:32:23.515 --> 00:32:25.548
That's what's up.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:26.951
CARRIE:
Uh, how about you, young lady?

00:32:26.953 --> 00:32:28.586
Oh.

00:32:28.588 --> 00:32:30.855
Hey, uh, what's up?
I'm Mila.

00:32:30.857 --> 00:32:32.690
I got kicked out
of my high school

00:32:32.692 --> 00:32:34.324
because they found
some Molly in my locker.

00:32:34.326 --> 00:32:35.760
- Mm-hmm.
- And I can avoid juvie

00:32:35.762 --> 00:32:38.428
if I get my GED, so here I am.

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.664
- I'm so psyched.
- Cool.

00:32:40.666 --> 00:32:43.801
Look at you, all cute,
making America great again.

00:32:43.803 --> 00:32:46.402
- Bitch.
- (SCOFFS)

00:32:46.404 --> 00:32:47.872
So, what's your story, guy?

00:32:47.874 --> 00:32:50.107
Um, my name is Luis Flores.

00:32:50.109 --> 00:32:52.375
I had a great job as a waiter.

00:32:52.377 --> 00:32:54.345
Lot of money in tips.

00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:56.981
Until I was fired
without cause.

00:32:56.983 --> 00:32:58.716
No reason at all.

00:32:58.718 --> 00:33:00.285
(WHISPERS):
Fired.

00:33:01.653 --> 00:33:03.453
I don't know why...
I have no idea

00:33:03.455 --> 00:33:04.889
why he's looking at me.
I don't...

00:33:04.891 --> 00:33:06.423
It's fine.

00:33:06.425 --> 00:33:07.792
It's just a sign that it's time

00:33:07.794 --> 00:33:09.126
for me to do
something different.

00:33:09.128 --> 00:33:10.760
You see,
I came to this country

00:33:10.762 --> 00:33:12.562
from Mexico
to fulfill my dream

00:33:12.564 --> 00:33:13.797
of being a singer/songwriter.

00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:15.532
Oh, like Julio Iglesias?

00:33:15.534 --> 00:33:18.035
No, not like Julio Iglesias.

00:33:18.037 --> 00:33:19.737
He sucks.

00:33:19.739 --> 00:33:22.039
More like Justin Bieber

00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:25.608
or Justin Timberlake
or T-Pain.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:28.813
(LAUGHS)
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:33:28.815 --> 00:33:31.816
Aren't you a little old
to, like, be a pop star now?

00:33:31.818 --> 00:33:33.451
Aren't you a little young
to die?

00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:37.154
That's what's up.

00:33:37.156 --> 00:33:40.991
But now I'm going to become
a dental "hy-enist."

00:33:40.993 --> 00:33:43.894
'Cause I have great teeth.

00:33:43.896 --> 00:33:45.895
So I think I'd be a natural.

00:33:45.897 --> 00:33:47.564
A what?

00:33:47.566 --> 00:33:49.467
Dental hy-enist.

00:33:50.702 --> 00:33:52.101
Maybe you should see one.

00:33:52.103 --> 00:33:55.638
'Cause, you know what,
pretty stinky, guys.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.974
MAN:
All right. Hey, everybody.

00:33:56.976 --> 00:33:58.175
I'm Mackenzie.

00:33:58.177 --> 00:33:59.809
Uh, they call me Big Mac.

00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:01.678
Oh, we love McDonald's.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.946
What?

00:34:02.948 --> 00:34:05.049
McDonald's?

00:34:05.051 --> 00:34:06.683
I'm sorry, what?

00:34:06.685 --> 00:34:08.620
From the burger joint,
Mickey D's.

00:34:09.888 --> 00:34:11.423
Ronald McDonald's.

00:34:12.691 --> 00:34:13.923
"Two all-beef patties,

00:34:13.925 --> 00:34:15.524
"special sauce,
lettuce, cheese,

00:34:15.526 --> 00:34:17.761
- on a sesame-seed bun."
- Hmm.

00:34:17.763 --> 00:34:19.629
Never heard of it?

00:34:19.631 --> 00:34:22.565
(WHIMPERS, GROANS)

00:34:22.567 --> 00:34:25.869
Ooh, it's gonna be
a long semester.

00:34:25.871 --> 00:34:28.171
- Go on.
- MACKENZIE: Well, anyway,

00:34:28.173 --> 00:34:32.508
uh, my knees and my back
are really jacked up

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.011
from working at He-Man Movers
for 30 years,

00:34:35.013 --> 00:34:38.815
so I decided to get my GED
so that I could move up

00:34:38.817 --> 00:34:41.218
to a management position,
get off the truck.

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.820
And my son...
we call him Little Mac...

00:34:43.822 --> 00:34:45.822
he has decided
to drop out of school.

00:34:45.824 --> 00:34:48.625
So I made a deal with him:
I get my GED,

00:34:48.627 --> 00:34:50.193
he gets his diploma.

00:34:50.195 --> 00:34:51.593
(CHUCKLES)

00:34:51.595 --> 00:34:53.630
Little reverse psychology.

00:34:53.632 --> 00:34:55.031
All right.

00:34:55.033 --> 00:34:56.566
And what's your name?

00:34:56.568 --> 00:34:58.234
Hey, yo, what up? I'm Bobby.

00:34:58.236 --> 00:35:00.069
That's what...
that's what I'm talking about.

00:35:00.071 --> 00:35:02.906
That's Illuminati.
That's what I'm saying.

00:35:02.908 --> 00:35:04.807
See, the nigga here,
but he ain't here.

00:35:04.809 --> 00:35:06.643
It's like they watching you,

00:35:06.645 --> 00:35:08.245
and you think
you watching them.

00:35:08.247 --> 00:35:09.479
That's what they do.

00:35:09.481 --> 00:35:11.014
So you got Bobby Digital.

00:35:11.016 --> 00:35:12.849
He here, but he not.

00:35:12.851 --> 00:35:14.217
That's Tupac Coachella.

00:35:14.219 --> 00:35:15.251
(CHUCKLING):
You know what I'm saying?

00:35:15.253 --> 00:35:17.121
And he in the... You see?

00:35:17.123 --> 00:35:19.223
- Y'all don't...?
- All right, um...

00:35:19.225 --> 00:35:21.591
That probably ain't even
a real nigga. Hey.

00:35:21.593 --> 00:35:23.793
Are you on crack?
It's-it's Skype.

00:35:23.795 --> 00:35:26.595
(SIGHS) Whew, boy,
it's hard to be woke.

00:35:26.597 --> 00:35:27.729
(CHUCKLES)

00:35:27.731 --> 00:35:29.168
It's hard to be woke.

00:35:30.502 --> 00:35:32.769
What is "woke"?

00:35:32.771 --> 00:35:35.672
Okay, well, welcome, everyone.

00:35:35.674 --> 00:35:36.773
Really nice. We've all met.

00:35:36.775 --> 00:35:38.207
Well, we didn't, uh...

00:35:38.209 --> 00:35:40.109
we didn't meet...
we didn't meet everyone.

00:35:40.111 --> 00:35:42.211
- I didn't, uh...
- Teddy, uh, earlier,

00:35:42.213 --> 00:35:44.047
you said, unlike these folks,

00:35:44.049 --> 00:35:46.548
you're not a night school
type of person,

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:49.551
so I didn't think you cared.

00:35:49.553 --> 00:35:51.187
JAYLEN:
Is that right?

00:35:51.189 --> 00:35:53.122
TEDDY:
Well, you didn't...

00:35:53.124 --> 00:35:55.291
you didn't hear it right,
'cause I would never say that

00:35:55.293 --> 00:35:57.260
about people that I don't know.

00:35:57.262 --> 00:35:59.162
You know what?
This is a perfect segue.

00:35:59.164 --> 00:36:01.530
I'll just follow your lead,
and I'll stand up.

00:36:01.532 --> 00:36:03.031
I am Teddy Walker.

00:36:03.033 --> 00:36:06.002
Uh, a little fun fact about me:
I actually went here.

00:36:06.004 --> 00:36:08.738
- Oh.
- I'm also newly engaged.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.605
His fiancée is out
of his league.

00:36:10.607 --> 00:36:11.740
I'm sorry, what?

00:36:11.742 --> 00:36:12.841
Nothing. You're doing great.

00:36:12.843 --> 00:36:14.110
I said, "Keep going.

00:36:14.112 --> 00:36:15.811
Everybody loves you."

00:36:15.813 --> 00:36:17.613
CARRIE: How does
your fiancée feel about

00:36:17.615 --> 00:36:18.614
you being in night school?

00:36:18.616 --> 00:36:19.782
(HIGH-PITCHED):
Oh, she good.

00:36:19.784 --> 00:36:21.918
She loves it.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.919
(CHUCKLES)
He ain't told her shit.

00:36:23.921 --> 00:36:25.121
TEDDY:
She loves it.

00:36:25.123 --> 00:36:26.655
I noticed that your voice

00:36:26.657 --> 00:36:28.156
just went up a whole octave.

00:36:28.158 --> 00:36:31.626
Now, from my studies
of psychology in grad school,

00:36:31.628 --> 00:36:34.563
I know that that means
that you're bullshitting.

00:36:34.565 --> 00:36:35.931
Ain't no bullshit in me.

00:36:35.933 --> 00:36:37.899
I tell you what...
if you're lying with her,

00:36:37.901 --> 00:36:40.068
- don't lie to her.
- But I don't... I don't lie.

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.738
Sound like some bullshit to me.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.006
Everyone sees
right through you.

00:36:43.008 --> 00:36:44.573
- Okay, how about we...?
- Mm-hmm.

00:36:44.575 --> 00:36:46.641
If we go by your theory
about the voice thing...

00:36:46.643 --> 00:36:47.976
I think that we're...
I think that we're all

00:36:47.978 --> 00:36:49.278
- getting off track.
- ...he's lied four times.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.079
This boy definitely lying.

00:36:51.081 --> 00:36:53.116
- I am not.
- You can't outsmart Mother Nature.

00:36:53.118 --> 00:36:54.350
And that's what...
that-that's what a woman is.

00:36:54.352 --> 00:36:56.685
- Brother.
- Especially a black woman.

00:36:56.687 --> 00:36:57.987
- You know, how...
- That's correct.

00:36:57.989 --> 00:36:59.921
- Girls are smart, dude.
- Goddamn it.

00:36:59.923 --> 00:37:00.756
- Like, literally, damn it.
- (OTHERS MURMURING)

00:37:00.758 --> 00:37:02.624
Even if he didn't tell her,
so what?

00:37:02.626 --> 00:37:03.692
- Okay, here's the thing.
- I told Randy

00:37:03.694 --> 00:37:05.762
that he was the first guy
I slept with... not true.

00:37:05.764 --> 00:37:07.330
Hey, I'm trying to introduce
myself, and I can't...

00:37:07.332 --> 00:37:09.198
You don't respect your queen,
'cause if you did,

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.866
- that bitch would know where you at.
- Okay.

00:37:10.868 --> 00:37:12.268
Teddy.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.235
Don't lie to your queen.

00:37:13.237 --> 00:37:14.369
- Okay, guys.
- JAYLEN: If you're busting off

00:37:14.371 --> 00:37:17.140
in her guts like that,
she might be carrying your seed.

00:37:17.142 --> 00:37:18.274
I feel like
this conversation...

00:37:18.276 --> 00:37:19.841
So you ain't just lying to her;
you lying to your child.

00:37:19.843 --> 00:37:21.044
- Shit!
- If it's your bottom bitch,

00:37:21.046 --> 00:37:22.044
she know you stupid, fam.

00:37:22.046 --> 00:37:24.046
- All I'm saying, fam, look-look...
- Forget it.

00:37:24.048 --> 00:37:26.114
- Okay.
- How your fiancée don't know where you at?

that you can jump.

01:04:40.776 --> 01:04:41.976
in order to do
the Pythagorean theorem,

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:43.743
you-you have to know
the hypotenuse.

01:04:43.745 --> 01:04:46.346
All we gotta do
is hypotenuse it.

01:04:46.348 --> 01:04:47.947
A-squared plus B-squared
equals C-squared.

01:04:47.949 --> 01:04:49.716
If you know... know two sides,

01:04:49.718 --> 01:04:51.018
then that'll help you
figure out the third,

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.686
so it's roughly
six feet across,

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:55.388
and 15-squared is 225
divided by six-squared...

01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:56.890
- Hypotenuse it!
- Wait, what did I just say?

- MACKENZIE: It's 36.
- Yeah, 36.

You add it.

- No, no, you can do this.

I-I know this career change
has been a lot.

01:08:34.008 --> 01:08:36.041
It's a lot.

01:08:36.043 --> 01:08:38.744
It's so much.

01:08:38.746 --> 01:08:41.046
It's so, so much.

01:08:41.048 --> 01:08:42.883
Poor baby.

(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

01:08:47.154 --> 01:08:48.454
- I love you.
- Oh.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.862
I love you, too.

01:08:57.698 --> 01:08:59.264

Does that complete your order?

- WOMAN: Oh, wait, h-hold up.

01:09:01.068 --> 01:09:02.267
- I don't want that apple pie.
- Yeah, I can't... I'm sorry.

01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:03.635
It's-it's kind of hard
to hear you.

01:09:03.637 --> 01:09:04.770
There's a baby
in the background.

01:09:04.772 --> 01:09:06.138
Baby, I said be quiet.
Sit down!

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.739
Yeah, say-say it
one more time for me.

01:09:07.741 --> 01:09:09.207
- Say it... say it again.
- Is that burger good or what?

01:09:09.209 --> 01:09:11.076
TEDDY: Is there any way
I can get you to respectfully

01:09:11.078 --> 01:09:12.677
- shut that baby up?
- What'd you say?

01:09:12.679 --> 01:09:14.846
- Just pull up to the window, for the love...
- Heck no!

01:09:14.848 --> 01:09:16.615
Oh. Shit.

01:09:16.617 --> 01:09:17.883
- Shit.
- STEWART: It won't work.

01:09:17.885 --> 01:09:19.084
I see you, Teddy.

01:09:19.086 --> 01:09:20.584
It's not working.

- WOMAN: Hello?
- Shit.

01:09:24.991 --> 01:09:27.526
Teddy Walker.
I see you looking at...

01:09:27.528 --> 01:09:28.593
We're making eye contact
right now.

01:09:28.595 --> 01:09:30.262
Open your eyes, Teddy.

01:09:30.264 --> 01:09:32.697
- Teddy, come here!
- Stewart.

01:09:32.699 --> 01:09:33.932
Hey.

01:09:33.934 --> 01:09:35.067
Stewart,
you were saying "Teddy"?

01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:36.268
About ten times.

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:37.635
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:37.637 --> 01:09:38.637
- Do me a favor.
- Yep.

01:09:38.639 --> 01:09:40.539
Uh, go over there
and handle that situation

01:09:40.541 --> 01:09:41.472
- at the drive-through.
- Uh-huh.

01:09:41.474 --> 01:09:42.975
And I'll tell you
what to do after that,

01:09:42.977 --> 01:09:44.042
because I'm in charge.

01:09:44.044 --> 01:09:45.743
- Hey, so...
- WOMAN: Hello?

01:09:45.745 --> 01:09:47.545
Give me a second. M-Ma'am...

01:09:47.547 --> 01:09:49.013
- I said I didn't want the pie.
- Okay, ma'am, ma...

01:09:49.015 --> 01:09:49.947
- She don't want the pie.
- Uh-uh.

01:09:49.949 --> 01:09:51.850
Take the pie off.
She want to get the...

01:09:51.852 --> 01:09:53.151
WOMAN:
I said I ain't getting a pie.

01:09:53.153 --> 01:09:54.219
- TEDDY: Pull up!
- You heard me.

01:09:54.221 --> 01:09:55.686
- Pull up to the window!
- All right.

01:09:55.688 --> 01:09:57.022
TEDDY:
When she pull up, tell me,

01:09:57.024 --> 01:09:58.956
'cause I'm gonna come punch
the baby in the face.

01:09:58.958 --> 01:10:01.125
God don't see everything.
Just let me know.

01:10:01.127 --> 01:10:05.063
Hey, talk to me, man.
How you doing?

01:10:05.065 --> 01:10:07.065
You know, I thought
it was the Woodbridge punks

01:10:07.067 --> 01:10:09.800
that broke into the school,
but now it all makes sense.

01:10:09.802 --> 01:10:12.903
I found this

01:10:12.905 --> 01:10:14.508
at the scene of the crime.

01:10:15.876 --> 01:10:17.242
So, what'd you do, huh?

01:10:17.244 --> 01:10:18.310
Break into my computer?

01:10:18.312 --> 01:10:20.145
- (CHUCKLES)
- Steal the midterm?

01:10:20.147 --> 01:10:21.712
Being a little paranoid,
aren't we, Stew?

01:10:21.714 --> 01:10:23.315
- Am I?
- Stewart, that's a plastic bag

01:10:23.317 --> 01:10:25.649
with a chicken wrapper in it
with the word "evidence"

01:10:25.651 --> 01:10:28.053
written on it, which is
probably in your handwriting.

01:10:28.055 --> 01:10:31.123
It's not exactly
a smoking gun, Stew.

01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:33.158
It's just a coincidence, right?

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.259
Probably.

01:10:34.261 --> 01:10:36.027
If you stole that test,

01:10:36.029 --> 01:10:37.862
I will find out, Teddy.

01:10:37.864 --> 01:10:40.832
I'm an honest man trying
to make an honest living.

01:10:40.834 --> 01:10:43.667
Teddy Walker does not cheat.

01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:45.071
You cheated.

Uh... whoa.

01:10:52.879 --> 01:10:55.247
Carrie, those are
very strong accusations.

01:10:55.249 --> 01:10:57.382
For real. Like, what?

01:10:57.384 --> 01:10:58.749
I'm offended.

01:10:58.751 --> 01:11:00.918
Well, I'll take note
of that, Teddy.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.088
Which one of you want
to own up to it?

01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:04.755
I'm offended, too.

01:11:04.757 --> 01:11:06.191
Bobby?

01:11:06.193 --> 01:11:07.625
You a criminal.

01:11:07.627 --> 01:11:08.726
You obviously not good at it.

That's why you in jail.

01:11:10.029 --> 01:11:11.996
Did you orchestrate
this whole thing?

01:11:11.998 --> 01:11:14.732
I mean, why you gonna
pick on me and profile me?

01:11:14.734 --> 01:11:16.734
I'm the only one
locked up here.

01:11:16.736 --> 01:11:18.836
So, if I'm locked up in here,

01:11:18.838 --> 01:11:21.372
how can I be out there
stealing the test, Miss Carrie?

01:11:21.374 --> 01:11:23.074

Oh, oh, wait a minute.

You want to explain to me
how you got a perfect score?

Here's the thing, all right?

01:11:41.428 --> 01:11:44.261
I know I didn't get
a perfect score,

01:11:44.263 --> 01:11:45.729
because I missed a few
on purpose.

01:11:45.731 --> 01:11:46.730

with politicians.

'Cause they all cheaters.

sound like "cheaters."

will give you that Trump color.

- Yeah.

01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:26.223
- No.
- And as for the rest of you,

01:14:26.225 --> 01:14:27.924
I want you to think
long and hard

01:14:27.926 --> 01:14:30.394
about if you really want this.

01:14:30.396 --> 01:14:32.128

(CRYING):
I don't know none of this shit.

01:14:40.071 --> 01:14:41.070
I need you.

01:14:41.072 --> 01:14:44.474
- I need your help.
- Put your damn hand down.

01:14:44.476 --> 01:14:46.276
I'm going to Rainbows
before they close.

01:14:46.278 --> 01:14:48.444
That's emotional shopping,
Carrie.

01:14:48.446 --> 01:14:50.147
It's Rainbows, motherfucker.

01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:51.417
Shit is cheap.

01:14:53.419 --> 01:14:56.052
(LONG SIGH)

01:14:56.054 --> 01:14:58.421
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

01:14:58.423 --> 01:15:00.922
You are stupid.

01:15:00.924 --> 01:15:03.960
She didn't know what was
going on until you admitted it.

01:15:03.962 --> 01:15:05.396
We had her right up
till the end,

01:15:05.398 --> 01:15:08.431
and then Teddy,

01:15:08.433 --> 01:15:10.900
- (BOOK STRIKES MACKENZIE)
- Oh, Teddy!

01:15:10.902 --> 01:15:12.368
JAYLEN:
You deserved that.

01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:14.571
LISA:
A school?

01:15:14.573 --> 01:15:17.574
We've never taken on
a project like that.

01:15:17.576 --> 01:15:20.510
STEWART: Well, I am
an outside-of-the-box thinker.

01:15:20.512 --> 01:15:22.278
That's just who I am.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.646
I think that if students
are excited

01:15:23.648 --> 01:15:25.148
about their environment,

01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:27.083
they'll be excited
about learning.

01:15:27.085 --> 01:15:28.284
That makes total sense.

01:15:28.286 --> 01:15:29.653
I know I would.

01:15:29.655 --> 01:15:31.120
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

01:15:31.122 --> 01:15:32.455
If you're interested,
I'd love to give you

01:15:32.457 --> 01:15:33.956
a tour of the school.

01:15:33.958 --> 01:15:35.558
You could come by any day,
or you know what,

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.125
you could even come
after school.

01:15:37.127 --> 01:15:40.098
We have several
night programs as well.

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.334
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:15:44.336 --> 01:15:46.402
CARRIE (IN DISTANCE):
Okay, show me what you got.

01:15:46.404 --> 01:15:48.003
Show me what you got!

01:15:48.005 --> 01:15:50.206
What you got for me?
Come on.

01:15:50.208 --> 01:15:52.141
Light up. What you got?

01:15:52.143 --> 01:15:54.043
Oh, you killing me!

01:15:54.045 --> 01:15:55.578
You won. Congratulations.

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:57.547
I'm proud of you, boo.

01:15:57.549 --> 01:15:59.515
Now, it's not cool
that you beat your teacher

01:15:59.517 --> 01:16:01.517
at Texas hold 'em,
but I like the way

01:16:01.519 --> 01:16:04.020
you nailed down the
calculations on the pot odds,

01:16:04.022 --> 01:16:06.255
so I'm gonna let this slide.

01:16:06.257 --> 01:16:08.291
Now, remember what I said.

01:16:08.293 --> 01:16:11.093
There are no shortcuts.
You gotta work your butt off.

01:16:11.095 --> 01:16:13.128
Okay? Give me some love.

01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:15.465
Mmm. So proud of you.

01:16:15.467 --> 01:16:17.200
Go on and have a good day, now.

01:16:17.202 --> 01:16:19.237
Maybe one day,
I'll take you to Vegas.

01:16:21.706 --> 01:16:23.508
(SIGHS)

01:16:26.311 --> 01:16:27.512
That was cool.

01:16:29.347 --> 01:16:32.047
You know, uh, this used to be
the special ed classroom

01:16:32.049 --> 01:16:33.316
when I went here.

01:16:33.318 --> 01:16:34.950
It still is.

01:16:34.952 --> 01:16:36.686
You teach special ed?

01:16:36.688 --> 01:16:40.390
Special ed is one
of my sections.

01:16:40.392 --> 01:16:42.926
It's one of my favorites,
actually.

01:16:44.729 --> 01:16:48.296
You know, that kid reminds me
a lot of myself.

01:16:48.298 --> 01:16:49.699
(CHUCKLES)
I couldn't do math for shit

01:16:49.701 --> 01:16:51.401
when I was in school.

01:16:51.403 --> 01:16:53.436
Difference is I didn't have
a teacher like you

01:16:53.438 --> 01:16:55.671
that was willing
to stay behind and help me.

01:16:55.673 --> 01:16:57.473
I know what you're doing,
Teddy.

01:16:57.475 --> 01:17:01.009
And I admit it was
very cool of you

01:17:01.011 --> 01:17:03.379
to take the fall
for your classmates,

01:17:03.381 --> 01:17:04.580
but you're a hustler.

01:17:04.582 --> 01:17:07.350
Trying to skate by
without doing the work.

01:17:07.352 --> 01:17:09.151
You should know
you can't hustle me.

01:17:09.153 --> 01:17:10.152
I do.

01:17:10.154 --> 01:17:12.688
Okay? I-I do know that.

01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:14.991
And I promise you I'm done.

01:17:14.993 --> 01:17:16.526
I'm not hustling no more.

01:17:16.528 --> 01:17:19.529
Night school is about
second chances.

01:17:19.531 --> 01:17:21.329
And if I don't get
this second chance,

01:17:21.331 --> 01:17:22.698
then it's over for me.

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:25.233
Night school
is all that I have.

01:17:25.235 --> 01:17:27.370
(SIGHS)

01:17:27.372 --> 01:17:29.238
Please.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.707
I'll consider it
on one condition.

01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:33.375
Whatever it is.

01:17:33.377 --> 01:17:35.243
We get you tested.

01:17:35.245 --> 01:17:37.581
For STDs? That's not an issue.

01:17:39.083 --> 01:17:40.283
I don't mind that. I mean...

01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:41.317
(SIGHS) Goddamn it.

01:17:41.319 --> 01:17:43.051
There was one time where, uh,

01:17:43.053 --> 01:17:44.754
the condom popped 'cause I put
my balls inside of...

01:17:44.756 --> 01:17:47.589
No, you idiot.

01:17:47.591 --> 01:17:49.393
For learning disabilities.

01:17:51.262 --> 01:17:54.397
Nobody cares about your
escapades with your bitches.

01:17:54.399 --> 01:17:56.599
TEDDY:
So, what are the test results,

01:17:56.601 --> 01:17:57.599
Carrie?

01:17:57.601 --> 01:18:00.237
Teddy, the issue is...

01:18:01.538 --> 01:18:03.475
...you're clinically dumb.

01:18:06.778 --> 01:18:08.510
I knew it.

01:18:08.512 --> 01:18:11.112
I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it was a mistake.

01:18:11.114 --> 01:18:13.548
(LAUGHS) Boy, I'm sorry.
I'm just messing with you.

01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:15.183
- Come on, Carrie.
- Look, look.

01:18:15.185 --> 01:18:16.419
My suspicions were right,

01:18:16.421 --> 01:18:19.421
and you, my friend,
are dyslexic.

01:18:19.423 --> 01:18:21.323
Okay.

01:18:21.325 --> 01:18:23.325
Okay, so that just means
I'm having problems

01:18:23.327 --> 01:18:25.059
with my reading
and my writing, right?

01:18:25.061 --> 01:18:27.730
Yep, but you also have
dyscalculia.

01:18:27.732 --> 01:18:29.665
Discalcu... I don't even know
how to pronounce that.

01:18:29.667 --> 01:18:33.003
Basically, it's like dyslexia
but with math.

01:18:35.105 --> 01:18:36.538
That's what I got.

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:38.073
I knew it.

01:18:38.075 --> 01:18:39.742
Now that you say it,
it makes sense.

01:18:39.744 --> 01:18:41.142
If you take me to a restaurant

01:18:41.144 --> 01:18:42.377
and you say,
"Teddy, leave the tip,"

01:18:42.379 --> 01:18:43.445
I'm-I'm all over the place.

01:18:43.447 --> 01:18:44.613
That's exactly what it is.

01:18:44.615 --> 01:18:46.448
- We did it.
- Oh, we're not done.

01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:48.783
You also have
a processing disorder.

01:18:48.785 --> 01:18:51.186
I got a touch
of prostate cancer?

01:18:51.188 --> 01:18:53.255
She didn't touch my ass
one time.

01:18:53.257 --> 01:18:55.257
I said "processing disorder."

01:18:55.259 --> 01:18:57.526
Carrie, if you're not
going to help me,

01:18:57.528 --> 01:18:58.827
then we're wasting our time.

01:18:58.829 --> 01:19:01.363
Explain to me
what this stuff is.

01:19:01.365 --> 01:19:02.598
If I got a proc...

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.701
Oh, my God.

01:19:05.302 --> 01:19:07.271
I'm not processing it.

01:19:08.739 --> 01:19:11.138
I didn't process
none of that shit.

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:14.376
You are just one big,
beautiful mixed drink

01:19:14.378 --> 01:19:15.778
of learning disabilities.

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:17.412
So I'm not dumb?

01:19:17.414 --> 01:19:19.447
Boy, I was just playing
when I said that earlier.

01:19:19.449 --> 01:19:22.350
No good teacher would ever
call their students dumb.

01:19:22.352 --> 01:19:23.852
Okay.

01:19:23.854 --> 01:19:25.820
So, how do we fix it?
Let's talk solution.

01:19:25.822 --> 01:19:27.522
Well, there's no cure
for what you have.

01:19:27.524 --> 01:19:29.824
Oh, my God.

01:19:29.826 --> 01:19:32.160
I got learning herpes?

01:19:32.162 --> 01:19:33.562
Boy...

01:19:33.564 --> 01:19:34.829
Oh, shit.

01:19:34.831 --> 01:19:37.197
There is no such thing
as learning herpes.

01:19:37.199 --> 01:19:39.267
I'm blistering up.

01:19:39.269 --> 01:19:41.436
It's 'cause I'm trying
to think.

01:19:41.438 --> 01:19:43.605
- Hey, Teddy!
- Hey, Mac.

01:19:43.607 --> 01:19:45.607
- Ringleader.
- Hi, guys.

01:19:45.609 --> 01:19:48.375
- Teddy!
- Yeah, Teddy! Teddy!

01:19:48.377 --> 01:19:50.211
Teaching the conventional way

01:19:50.213 --> 01:19:53.148
just isn't gonna
get it done for Teddy,

01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:54.416
so we're gonna mix it up.

01:19:54.418 --> 01:19:56.418
You out here getting it in.

01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:58.653
What's going on, Carrie?
Why you in here?

01:19:58.655 --> 01:20:00.655
Why you in the ring?
What's going on?

01:20:00.657 --> 01:20:03.458
Teddy, your difficulties
are focus-related.

01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:04.359
Uh-huh.

01:20:04.361 --> 01:20:06.328
My goal is to remove
that mind chatter

01:20:06.330 --> 01:20:09.497
so you can achieve properly
unencumbered neural pathways.

01:20:09.499 --> 01:20:10.865
And this isn't a ring.

01:20:10.867 --> 01:20:12.333
It's a hexagon.

01:20:12.335 --> 01:20:14.269
Huh. Oh, it is.

01:20:14.271 --> 01:20:15.403
Yeah, well...

01:20:15.405 --> 01:20:16.871
Why you taking your shoes off?

01:20:16.873 --> 01:20:18.607
Is this somebody's carpet?

01:20:18.609 --> 01:20:20.408
Teddy, what's
the square root of 81?

01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:21.576
What?

01:20:21.578 --> 01:20:24.545
- (GRUNTS)
- Ow! Ow!

01:20:24.547 --> 01:20:27.215
- Shit!
- What's the square root of 81?

01:20:27.217 --> 01:20:29.284
I don't know.
(GROANS) What you do...?

01:20:29.286 --> 01:20:31.353
- Ow! Carrie!
- What's the square root of 81?

01:20:31.355 --> 01:20:32.353
You breaking my arm!

01:20:32.355 --> 01:20:33.888
Come on, we're clearing
those neural pathways.

01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:35.656
- No! (SCREAMS)
- Stop. Hey!

01:20:35.658 --> 01:20:37.424
- What you doing?
- Focus!

01:20:37.426 --> 01:20:40.362
- (SCREAMS)
- Square root! Focus!

01:20:40.364 --> 01:20:41.663

- Oh, God! (SCREAMS)

01:20:44.333 --> 01:20:47.234

Teddy, concentrate.

01:20:47.236 --> 01:20:48.569

I'm-I'm feeling fine,

at the restaurant when Teddy
pulled all of his pubes,

01:32:22.595 --> 01:32:24.528
and then... and he put 'em
in the cheesecake

01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:25.997
to get out of paying.

- No.

01:32:45.150 --> 01:32:47.086
No, Teddy, I'm done
with your explanations.

01:32:48.954 --> 01:32:50.457
You lied to me
about everything.

01:32:51.957 --> 01:32:53.090
Why?

01:32:53.092 --> 01:32:55.025

Teddy, I make my own money.

01:32:57.196 --> 01:32:59.529
You think I care about
what kind of car you drive

01:32:59.531 --> 01:33:01.699
or what kind of watch
you have on?

01:33:01.701 --> 01:33:04.101
That's not me.

If you don't know me,

01:33:08.607 --> 01:33:09.673
then you couldn't truly love me.

to the apartment tonight.

with your night school friend.

Maybe she'd have
some use for this.

01:33:28.661 --> 01:33:31.263

01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:40.506
"I wish I ain't never had you."

01:47:40.508 --> 01:47:43.108
Or like, uh,

01:47:43.110 --> 01:47:44.843
- "That was a waste of sperm."
- CARRIE: Oh!

- Oh.
- "Oh, God, if I could

01:47:46.513 --> 01:47:48.814
get that nut back."
I remember you said that.

01:47:48.816 --> 01:47:51.117
But all that stuff
was said out of love

01:47:51.119 --> 01:47:52.884
to motivate me and push me.

01:47:52.886 --> 01:47:54.920
And you thought
you didn't do good,

01:47:54.922 --> 01:47:56.090

I don't have any money.
